## Welcome to our curated list of AI memory tools
You can see the projects split across various dimensions
1. Open-source projects vs Closed-source projects and companies
2. Graph, Vector, or Both
3. Memory, Framework, Optimizer, or Storage


There might be many more companies we are not aware of. Your feedback and contributions are appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è
